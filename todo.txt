ToDo:

gameobject:
    - update bounds checking to allow for screen resizing and sprite size changes

Display:
    - create correct initialisation sequence
    - allow display to load it's own sprites which will remove redundant info in game.py

ObjectManager:
    - split spawnasteroid() into two functiosn, one to test if a new asteroid is needed and one to actually spawn it?
    - turn object detection into one itteration by iterrating over asteroids to reduce overhead

Controls:
    - find a proper home for this, and perhaps split the handleEvent() function into a few smaller ones
